This repository contains some problem solutions to gear up understanding on Linear and non linear data structures

## Problem statement 1

### Write a program of Balancing Brackets, use a suitable data structure to print whether the string entered is a Balanced Brackets or Unbalanced String
Sample input

( [ [ { } ] ] )

Sample Output

The entered String has Balanced Brackets

Sample Input

( [ [ { } ] ] ) )

Sample Output

The entered Strings do not contain Balanced Brackets

## Problem statement 2

### Find a pair with a given sum in Binary Search Tree

In Order form: 10 20 30 40 50 60 70

Sum = 130

Pair is (60,70)


If the sum is not found, print nodes are not found
